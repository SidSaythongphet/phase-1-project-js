# **Two Minutes a Day Journal**

## Overview
The Two-Minute Rule states “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” With this idea in mind, I thought to develop this single-page application to encourage a new habit in writing. 

## Directions
To begin, click 'Journal' in the top left corner to pull up the journal page. On this page, before you are able to even type in the text area, you are asked to pick a topic via a drop down menu and a specific time to write for via radio buttons. Defaults are "Whatever is on my mind!" and 2 minutes, respectively. 
    
 Once you are ready to begin, click 'Start'. At this point two things happen. First, the text area becomes interactive and you are able to begin writing. Second, the area that held the duration options turns into your timer. Once the timer finishes, the text area will once again become inactive.

When the timer is finished, you are then able to either submit your journal entry or reset and start over if you'd like. Upon clicking on the submit button, you are directed to the 'Entries' page.

On the 'Entries' page, you can see your past entries as dates. When clicked on, these dates expand and reveal your journal entry from that date. You can look back at past entries and even delete them when you see fit. To collapse the journal, click on the date again. On the left side of the page, you will see a collection of months that can be clicked on to filter the journals for that specific month. 
    
Enjoy looking back on all your previous journal entries and relieve your favorite memories and thoughts!
